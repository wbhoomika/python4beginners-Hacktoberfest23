# amstrong An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number, plenary number, or a plus perfect number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.

# In other words, for a number with n digits, if the sum of the nth powers of its digits is equal to the number itself, then it is an Armstrong number.

# For example, let's take the number 153:

# - The number of digits in 153 is 3.
# - The sum of the cubes of its digits is: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.

# Since the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself, 153 is an Armstrong number.
